## GitHub Repository

All documentation has been pushed to the official GitHub repository:
- Repository: [alfred-docs-repo](https://github.com/locotoki/alfred-docs-repo)

## Next Steps

1. Begin preparation for Phase 3: Agent Documentation
   - Identify key agent documentation to migrate next
   - Create migration plan for agent documentation

2. Address outstanding issues:
   - Add missing metadata to documents
   - Fix broken links in architecture documentation
   - Resolve duplicate content for agent implementations

3. Prepare for continued documentation work:
   - Update templates based on lessons learned
   - Improve validation tools
   - Enhance cross-referencing between documents

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has been successfully completed with the migration of all 23 high-priority documents. The documentation now provides a solid foundation for understanding the platform's architecture, core components, APIs, and integration points. The project is on track to meet all migration goals, with Phase 3 scheduled to begin on June 12, 2025.
