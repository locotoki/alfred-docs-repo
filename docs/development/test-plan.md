# Test Plan & Test Cases

## 1. Overview

The Test Plan outlines the testing strategy, objectives, and test cases for ensuring the Alfred Agent Platform functions as expected. It covers the types of testing to be performed, the tools used, and the specific test cases for the various platform components (e.g., agents, Pub/Sub, API endpoints, etc.).

## 2. Testing Objectives

The primary goal is to ensure that:

- **Functional correctness**: All components behave according to the specifications
- **Integration correctness**: The entire system works cohesively when components interact (e.g., agent communication via Pub/Sub)
- **Performance**: The system can handle the expected load and scale appropriately
- **Reliability**: The system should handle errors gracefully (e.g., retries, task failure handling)
- **Security**: Ensure sensitive data and operations are secure

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1. Unit Testing

- **Objective**: Test individual components (e.g., agent logic, utility functions, API helpers) to ensure they work in isolation
- **Tools**: **pytest**, **unittest**
- **Scope**: Each agent's logic (e.g., **SocialIntelligenceAgent**, **LegalComplianceAgent**), helper functions, Pub/Sub message formatting, and error handling

**Examples of Unit Tests**:

- **Agent Logic**: Test if **LangChain** workflows produce the correct outputs
  - Input: Data for analysis
  - Expected Output: Correctly formatted summary, trends, or analysis results
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Test if tasks are correctly formatted and published to Pub/Sub
  - Input: Task data (e.g., `intent: TREND_ANALYSIS`)
  - Expected Output: Correct task envelope is published

### 3.2. Integration Testing

- **Objective**: Test interactions between components to ensure they work together (e.g., interaction between **Alfred** Slack bot and **Pub/Sub**, **Supabase** storage)
- **Tools**: **pytest**, **mock**, **requests**
- **Scope**: Interaction between **Slack**, **Pub/Sub**, **Supabase**, **Qdrant**, and **LangChain** agents

**Examples of Integration Tests**:

- **Task Creation**: Ensure tasks published to Pub/Sub are correctly processed by agents
  - Input: `a2a.tasks.create` task
  - Expected Output: Task is received by the correct agent and processed
- **State Storage**: Verify that task results are correctly stored in **Supabase** and retrievable via API endpoints
  - Input: Completed task
  - Expected Output: Task result is stored and can be retrieved via the `/tasks/{task_id}/results` API

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure the full system works as expected, from task initiation to completion
- **Tools**: **Selenium**, **Cypress**, **Postman**, **pytest**
- **Scope**: Complete task lifecycle, including task creation, agent processing, data storage, and result retrieval

**Examples of E2E Tests**:

- **Task Lifecycle**: Ensure a task can be created via **Slack**, processed by the agent, and results are retrieved via **Supabase**
  - Input: User command via **Slack** to start a task (e.g., `TREND_ANALYSIS`)
  - Expected Output: Task is processed, result is stored, and updated status is visible in the UI
- **Real-time Updates**: Test that **Supabase Realtime** pushes updates to the UI as task statuses change
  - Input: Task status changes (e.g., from `processing` to `completed`)
  - Expected Output: Real-time update to **Mission Control UI**

### 3.4. Load Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure the system can handle the expected load and scale appropriately
- **Tools**: **Locust**, **Apache JMeter**
- **Scope**: Simulate multiple tasks being processed simultaneously

**Example of Load Test**:

- **Task Processing Load**: Simulate 1,000 simultaneous task requests
  - Input: 1,000 tasks published to Pub/Sub
  - Expected Output: System processes tasks efficiently without errors or significant delays

### 3.5. Security Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure the system is secure from common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- **Tools**: **OWASP ZAP**, **Burp Suite**
- **Scope**: Security checks on API endpoints, authentication flows, and data storage

**Examples of Security Tests**:

- **API Security**: Ensure sensitive endpoints (e.g., task creation, task results retrieval) are protected by proper authentication
  - Input: Unauthenticated request to access task results
  - Expected Output: Access denied with a 401 Unauthorized response
- **Data Encryption**: Test that sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest

## 4. Detailed Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Task Creation

- **Objective**: Verify that a task is correctly created and published
- **Precondition**: System is running and connected to Pub/Sub
- **Steps**:
  1. Trigger task creation via **Slack**
  2. Verify that a task is published to **Pub/Sub** with the correct **task_id** and **intent**
- **Expected Result**: Task is published with the correct task envelope schema
- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Task envelope schema validation passes

### Test Case 2: Agent Processing

- **Objective**: Ensure that the agent correctly processes the task
- **Precondition**: Task is published to `a2a.tasks.create` topic
- **Steps**:
  1. Agent subscribes to `a2a.tasks.create`
  2. Agent processes the task and updates the task status
- **Expected Result**: Task status is updated correctly in **Supabase** and results are generated
- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Task status changes to "completed" and contains valid results

### Test Case 3: Task Result Retrieval

- **Objective**: Verify that task results can be retrieved
- **Precondition**: Task is processed and results are stored
- **Steps**:
  1. Retrieve task results using the `/tasks/{task_id}/results` endpoint
- **Expected Result**: Task results are returned correctly, including any output data
- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: API returns 200 OK with valid result data

### Test Case 4: Exactly-Once Processing

- **Objective**: Verify that tasks are processed exactly once
- **Precondition**: System is running with the exactly-once processing mechanism
- **Steps**:
  1. Publish the same task to Pub/Sub multiple times with the same task_id
  2. Verify that the task is processed only once
- **Expected Result**: Task is processed exactly once despite multiple publications
- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Only one task result entry exists in the database

### Test Case 5: Error Handling and Retry

- **Objective**: Verify that tasks that fail are retried according to the retry policy
- **Precondition**: System is running with retry mechanism
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a task that will fail on first attempt but succeed on retry
  2. Verify that the task is retried and eventually succeeds
- **Expected Result**: Task is retried and eventually marked as completed
- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Task status changes to "completed" after retries

### Test Case 6: Real-time Task Status Updates

- **Objective**: Verify that task status updates are pushed to clients in real-time
- **Precondition**: Task is being processed and client is subscribed to real-time updates
- **Steps**:
  1. Start processing a task
  2. Verify that status updates are pushed to the client via Supabase Realtime
- **Expected Result**: Client receives real-time updates as the task status changes
- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: All status changes are received by the client in real-time

## 5. Test Automation Strategy

### 5.1. Unit Test Automation

- Use pytest for unit tests with fixtures to mock dependencies
- Configure GitHub Actions to run unit tests on every PR
- Target test coverage of at least 90% for critical components

### 5.2. Integration Test Automation

- Use Docker Compose to set up test environment with all dependencies
- Run integration tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Mock external services where appropriate

### 5.3. E2E Test Automation

- Use Cypress for browser-based testing of the Mission Control UI
- Use Postman/Newman for API-focused E2E tests
- Configure E2E tests to run on staging environment after deployment

## 6. Test Reporting

- Generate test reports after each test run
- Include test coverage metrics, passed/failed tests, and execution time
- Integrate test reports with GitHub PR checks

## 7. Continuous Testing

- Run unit and integration tests on each PR
- Run E2E tests after deploying to staging
- Schedule regular security and load tests

## 8. Test Data Management

- Use separate test databases for testing
- Create data fixtures for common test scenarios
- Reset test data between test runs to ensure test isolation

## 9. Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the Alfred Agent Platform. By implementing these testing strategies, we can confidently make changes to the system while maintaining its functionality, performance, and security.
