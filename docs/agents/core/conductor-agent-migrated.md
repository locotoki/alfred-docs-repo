## Overview

The Conductor Agent is a core orchestration agent responsible for coordinating workflows, routing artifacts, and maintaining state machines across the Alfred Agent Platform v2. It serves as the central nervous system for agent communication, workflow execution, and system health monitoring, enabling seamless collaboration between specialized agents.

Designed with a focus on reliability and flexibility, the Conductor implements the mediator pattern to decouple individual agents while providing robust coordination services. It maintains knowledge of all active workflows and their current states, handles retry logic and failure recovery, and ensures that complex multi-agent processes execute reliably even in the face of transient failures or system disruptions.

## Capabilities

### Core Capabilities

- Routes artifacts between agents and services using the A2A protocol
- Maintains workflow state machines with LangGraph integration
- Monitors agent heartbeats for system health tracking
- Handles retry logic and failure recovery for resilient operations
- Orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows with parallel execution
- Provides real-time status monitoring of all workflows

### Limitations

- Does not perform content generation or analysis by itself
- Limited to workflows defined in its template library
- Requires all participating agents to implement the A2A protocol
- Performance constrained by message bus throughput
- State persistence may affect execution speed for complex workflows

## Workflows

This agent supports the following workflows:

- Hierarchical Task Decomposition: Breaking complex tasks into sub-tasks assigned to specialized agents
- Content Production Workflow: Coordinating multiple agents for end-to-end content creation
- Financial Analysis Workflow: Orchestrating financial data collection, analysis, and reporting
- Approval Workflow: Handling human-in-the-loop approval processes
- Infrastructure Management Workflow: Coordinating infrastructure design, implementation, and deployment

## Technical Specifications

### Input/Output Specifications

**Input Types:**
- Workflow definitions: YAML/JSON configuration of agent interactions and dependencies
- State transition events: Signals indicating progression through workflow states
- Agent heartbeats: Health status signals from active agents
- Artifact references: Pointers to data objects shared between agents

**Output Types:**
- Workflow status updates: Real-time state information for active workflows
- Agent dispatch instructions: Task assignments to participating agents
- System health metrics: Overall platform status and agent availability
- Event logs: Detailed operation records for auditing and debugging

### Tools and API Integrations

- Message bus (Google Cloud Pub/Sub): For inter-agent communication via A2A protocol
- State store (Supabase/PostgreSQL): For workflow state persistence
- LangGraph: For workflow orchestration and state management
- CrewAI: For team-based agent collaboration
- Metrics collector (Prometheus): For system health monitoring
- Logger (structured JSON): For audit and debugging

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Heartbeat Interval | Time between agent health checks (seconds) | 30 | Yes |
| State Persistence | Enable persistent workflow state | True | Yes |
| Retry Limit | Maximum number of task retries | 3 | No |
| Workflow Timeout | Maximum workflow runtime (minutes) | 60 | No |
| Concurrency Limit | Maximum parallel workflows | 10 | No |
| Dead Letter Queue | Enable unprocessable message storage | True | Yes |
| Human Approval Timeout | Timeout for human approvals (minutes) | 1440 | No |

## Performance and Scale

### Metrics and Performance Indicators

- Workflow completion rate: Percentage of workflows completing successfully (target: >99%)
- Average workflow latency: Time from start to completion (target: <10 minutes)
- Agent health rate: Percentage of agents responding to heartbeats (target: 100%)
- Message processing rate: Number of messages processed per second (target: >100/s)
- Recovery effectiveness: Percentage of failures successfully recovered (target: >90%)
- Workflow concurrency: Number of parallel workflows (target: 10-50 based on complexity)

### Scaling Considerations

The Conductor Agent is designed to scale horizontally with stateful replication across instances, maintaining workflow state in the shared database. For high-availability deployments, multiple instances can run in active-active configuration with leader election. Performance scales linearly with message bus throughput and database capacity, with the primary bottleneck typically being database I/O for state persistence.

Key scaling metrics include:
- Support for up to 10,000 concurrent workflow instances
- Processing of 500+ messages per second per instance
- Heartbeat monitoring for up to 100 agents per instance
- Linear scale-out with additional instances (recommended 3-5 instances for production)

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Multi-Agent Content Analysis

Orchestrating a content analysis workflow involving multiple specialized agents.

**Example:**
```
1. Workflow Definition:
   - Social Intelligence Agent analyzes trending topics
   - Niche-Scout evaluates opportunity scores
   - Seed-to-Blueprint generates content strategy

2. Conductor Responsibilities:
   - Trigger each agent in sequence based on dependency graph
   - Pass artifacts between steps using A2A protocol
   - Handle timeout/retry if any agent fails
   - Maintain workflow state in Supabase
   - Deliver final results to user interface
   - Provide real-time status updates to dashboard
```

### Use Case 2: System Health Management

Monitoring system health and responding to agent failures.

**Example:**
```
1. Continuous Monitoring Process:
   - Collect heartbeats from all active agents at 30-second intervals
   - Detect missing heartbeats or error conditions
   - Track message processing rates and response times
   - Analyze error patterns and transient failures

2. Recovery Actions:
   - Attempt agent restart or failover for non-responsive agents
   - Requeue failed tasks within configured retry limits
   - Alert administrators for persistent issues
   - Update system health dashboard with current status
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing components
```

### Use Case 3: Transactional Workflow with Rollback

Managing workflows that require all-or-nothing execution semantics.

**Example:**
```
1. Financial Reporting Workflow:
   - Financial-Tax Agent generates quarterly reports
   - Legal Compliance Agent validates regulatory compliance
   - Content Generation Agent creates narrative summary
   - Document Storage System preserves final reports

2. Transactional Guarantees:
   - Each step records rollback information
   - If any step fails, all previous operations are reversed
   - Rollbacks execute in reverse order of operations
   - Audit trail maintained for both attempts and rollbacks
   - Final status report indicates success or detailed failure information
```

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The Conductor Agent is implemented as a stateful service utilizing the LangGraph framework for workflow orchestration:

```

The Conductor uses a hybrid approach combining event-driven messaging for real-time responsiveness with periodic polling for reliability. The state machine implementation uses a formalized DSL for workflow definitions, allowing for declarative specification of complex workflow logic including branching, parallelism, and conditional execution.
