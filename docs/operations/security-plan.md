# AI Agent Platform v2 - Security Plan

## 1. Overview

This Security Plan ensures that the Alfred Agent Platform is secure, protecting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1. OAuth 2.0 / JWT

- Use **OAuth 2.0** or **JWT** for securing access to sensitive endpoints (task creation, task results)
- Ensure that agents communicate securely, using tokens for authentication and authorization
- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms

### 2.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Implement **RBAC** for different services (e.g., restricting access to task results based on user roles)
- Define clear roles for:
  - Administrators
  - Agent developers
  - End users
  - System services

## 3. Data Security

### 3.1. Encryption

- **In Transit**: Use **TLS/SSL** to encrypt data between services (e.g., Pub/Sub, API endpoints, frontend)
- **At Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored in **Supabase** and **Qdrant** using **AES-256** or similar encryption algorithms
- Ensure proper key management practices

### 3.2. Data Anonymization & Redaction

- Anonymize user data if required for compliance (e.g., GDPR)
- Redact sensitive fields in logs and error reports to prevent exposure of personal data
- Implement PII scrubbing middleware for all agent communication

## 4. Network Security

### 4.1. Firewalls & VPCs

- Deploy the platform within a properly configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Implement appropriate firewall rules to restrict access to services
- Use internal service networking where possible

### 4.2. API Security

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use API keys for external integrations
- Monitor API usage patterns for anomalies

## 5. Monitoring & Logging

### 5.1. Security Logging

- Maintain comprehensive security logs
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Ensure logs contain necessary information for forensic analysis without PII

### 5.2. Security Monitoring

- Set up alerting for unusual authentication patterns
- Monitor for brute force attempts
- Track service-to-service communication patterns

## 6. Incident Detection & Response

### 6.1. Intrusion Detection

- Implement monitoring for potential security breaches or suspicious activities
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns or failed login attempts
- Deploy tools to detect potential intrusions

### 6.2. Incident Response

- Create a detailed incident response plan for data breaches or other security incidents
- Implement regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities
- Establish clear communication channels for security incidents

## 7. Compliance

### 7.1. Regulatory Compliance

- Ensure the platform adheres to relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Implement data retention policies that comply with regulatory requirements
- Provide mechanisms for data subject access requests

### 7.2. Security Standards

- Follow industry best practices (OWASP, CIS)
- Consider SOC 2 compliance if required by enterprise clients
- Document security controls for audit purposes

## 8. Ongoing Security

### 8.1. Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
- Subscribe to security advisories for key components
- Implement automated vulnerability scanning

### 8.2. Security Training

- Provide security training for all developers
- Implement secure coding practices
- Regular security reviews of new features and changes
